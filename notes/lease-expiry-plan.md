# Lease expiry (2026-11-03; branch `lease-expiry`)

The stage after `notes/lease-grant-plan.md`: drop the deployment premise `lease.leasesNoExpiry`, so
that a server that grants leases also expires them, and convert the lease subsystem to hub slots
(`notes/spec-first-plan.md`, "Hubs", "Incremental adoption" step 4). `notes/leases-plan.md`'s L5
(Q1 (a), "last"). Lean-first.

## Scope

### What Go does (the pin, `249d76bea7`)

- The lessor's `runLoop` (`server/lease/lessor.go:620`, not translated; `NewLessor` an axiom) every
  500 ms: `revokeExpiredLeases` (`:640`) sends a non-empty slice of the primary lessor's expired
  leases on `expiredC` (at most `leaseRevokeRate/2`; a non-blocking send, dropped when the receiver is
  busy), and `checkpointScheduledLeases` proposes checkpoints through the checkpointer.
- `EtcdServer.run` (`server/etcdserver/server.go:848`): `case leases := <-expiredLeaseC:
  s.revokeExpiredLeases(leases)`.
- `EtcdServer.revokeExpiredLeases` (`:860`, translated, no spec): `GoAttach` of a goroutine that
  returns unless `ensureLeadership()` (an axiom), then for each lease takes a slot of a
  `maxPendingRevokes` channel (or returns on `s.stopping`) and `GoAttach`es
  `s.LeaseRevoke(s.authStore.WithRoot(s.ctx), &LeaseRevokeRequest{ID: lid})`, logging an error.
- `EtcdServer.LeaseRevoke` (`v3_server.go`, translated, no spec): `raftRequestOnce` of the
  revocation, the response's type assertion.

### What the proof has (`lean` `8366afa266`)

- **The premise.** `lease.leasesNoExpiry` (opaque, `LessorBackend.lean`), in `%Hslg : ρ.rd.kv.lg =
  true → leasesNoExpiry ∧ runSnapLgOk` (`NewServer`, `isServerRun`), a hypothesis of
  `etcd_leasegrant_safe`. `NewLessor`'s `lessorExpiredC` gives a slice on `expiredC` `⌜¬
  leasesNoExpiry⌝ ∗ ∃ id, GA id`; `lessorOk`'s `ExpiredLeasesC` payload is `False`
  (`InvApplier.lean`, `srvGrantGuard lg on := ⌜leasesNoExpiry ∧ lg ∧ on = false⌝`); `run`'s expiry
  arm is dead (`srvGrantGuard_expired`).
- **The apply side of a revocation is done** (`notes/lease-revoke-plan.md`, frozen and proved):
  `chain_revoke` (`apply/Results.lean`), `backendStep .leaseRevoke` (`revokeLog`: the lease's keys
  deleted), `isApplyLessor`'s `revokeClause` of the real `lessor.Revoke`, `reqLeaseClass`.
- **The server's workload excludes it.** `rqOk lg log rq` is `False` at `.leaseRevoke` (and
  `.leaseCheckpoint`) whatever `lg` (`apply/Chain.lean:282`); `plainCover` admits no revocation and
  no leased put (`KVModelDefs.lean:72`: `op.leaseID = 0`); `kvInv`'s `plainLogM γk.cmp γk.lg` has
  grants, no revocations. The KV model has `KVOp.leaseRevoke` (unit T3) but the table is not tied to
  the lessor (lease-grant's S1 (a), narrow).
- **The read side.** `leaseTTLOut`'s not-found arm (`TTL = -1`, `InvLeaseRead.lean:153`) states no
  fact of the lessor's history; `leaseLeasesOut` gives `leaseIdsAt γl i ids` at `i ≥ m`; the
  lessor's history (`lessorRdInv`) is a monotone list of snapshots, a revocation one more.
- **Hubs** (lease-grant's "Hubs touched"): `%Hslg`, `on = true → lg = false` and `KVNames.lg`/
  `AEnv.lg` inline in `NewServer.specG`, `bootOk`, `isServerRun`; per the hub plan's step 4 they
  become `lease.Names`/`lease.bootCfg`/`lease.srvInv` here.

### What admitting expiry breaks (lease-grant's rule: every place that rules the case out)

1. `lessorOk`'s `ExpiredLeasesC` payload `False` and `run`'s dead arm: the arm becomes live, and
   `revokeExpiredLeases`, `LeaseRevoke` need specs (and `GoAttach`'s wait group, the
   `maxPendingRevokes` channel, `s.stopping`, `ensureLeadership`, `WithRoot`).
2. `rqOk .leaseRevoke = False`, `plainCover`, `reqPropOkW`, `kvInv`'s `plainLogM`: a revocation
   proposed by the server itself (no client asked) must be admitted into the request path and the
   KV invariant; a revocation's KV step (`revokeLog`) with no leased keys deletes nothing.
3. The monotone "granted, still live" reading of `lessorGrantOkG`'s `G` and of the listing: a lease
   granted at `i` may be gone at `j > i`. `leasegrant`'s `Main` (panics unless `Leases` lists the
   grant) is then **not provable** without a timing premise: its check is the premise's.
4. `srvGrantOpen` (sorry `srvGrantOpen_open`, the snapshot's `Recover`): unaffected in statement
   (a snapshot's lessor may now have fewer leases), to recheck in Draft.
5. The checkpoints (`ckptEffectsOk`, opaque) are unchanged: expiry adds none.

## Scope questions (for the user)

- **Q1. What the result says.**
  (a) *Server-side expiry, a new expiry-robust example* (recommended): the server admits its own
  revocations (items 1-2; leased puts stay out, so a revocation deletes no key); `leasesNoExpiry`
  leaves the server's statements; a new example `etcd/leaseexpiry` grants a short lease (the minimum
  TTL), polls `TimeToLive` until it answers not found, then panics if `Leases` still lists it. Not
  found is `TTL = -1 ∧ GrantedTTL = 0`: `TTL = -1` alone is also the answer for a lease still in the
  lessor but overdue by a second or more (`int64(le.Remaining().Seconds())`, `v3_server.go:650`;
  `Remaining` goes negative), which `Leases` still lists, so a check on `TTL` alone is false. That
  needs `leaseTTLOut`'s not-found arm to state the lease's absence at an index (a restated
  trust-boundary `leaseTimeToLive`, for Freeze) and "no other grant of that id" (the example grants
  once). `leasegrant` keeps its check under `leasesNoExpiry`, now a premise of that example only.
  (b) *Full L5*: also leased puts and the KV table tied to the lessor (L3b), the example puts a key
  with the lease and checks it is gone after expiry. Several stages' worth; (a) is its first half.
  (c) *Server only*: (a) without the new example; `leasegrant` as in (a).
- **Q2. The hub conversion.** Convert lease to slots first (`lease.Names` from `KVNames.lg` and the
  lessor's names, `lease.bootCfg`, `lease.srvInv` holding `%Hslg`'s remainder), as its own
  mechanical commits before the expiry change, so the expiry change lands inside the sealed bodies
  (recommended); or the expiry change inline and the conversion after.
- **Q3. Auth.** Off, as lease-grant (`on = true → lg = false`): `WithRoot`'s context then carries no
  token that matters.
