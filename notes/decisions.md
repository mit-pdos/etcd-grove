# Decisions (Lean port)

Why the Lean port is the way it is. Newest last. The design of the proof itself is
recorded on `main` (`notes/decisions.md`); this file only covers choices the port
had to make.

## The Rocq module discipline, in Lean

**2026-10-06 · accepted**

`main` gives every Go function four files (`spec_`/`postulates_`/`proof_`/`link_`)
and uses Rocq's module system for two guarantees (main's decisions.md,
2026-09-14 and 2026-09-18): one Hoare triple per Go function, a duplicate being a
build error (`Include` of two signatures with the same label), and a proof that sees
only the *specs* of its callees, never their proofs (opaque ascription), which also
keeps the proofs checking in parallel.

**Decision:** per Go function, `Spec/<fn>.lean` holds `def <fn>.spec : Prop` (the
triple, with its binders); `Proof/<fn>.lean` holds
`theorem <fn>.wp_proof (h₁ : <callee₁>.spec) … : <fn>.spec`, importing only its
callees' `Spec` files; `Election.lean` instantiates each proof with its callees'
results. Lean's global names make a second `<fn>.spec` a build error (the first
guarantee); taking the callees' specs as hypotheses, with only their `Spec` files
imported, is the second. The `postulates_` file becomes the hypothesis list.
Trust-boundary triples are `axiom <fn>.wp_proof : <fn>.spec` and unfinished ones
`sorry`, so `#print axioms` on a result separates them as `main` does with
`Axiom`/`Admitted`.

**Rejected — one file per function holding spec and proof.** Then a caller imports
its callees' proofs, which both exposes them and serializes the build.
